RealAI Check is designed to help you navigate the complexities of AI-generated content and misinformation. We operate with a commitment to transparency, accuracy, and user understanding, inspired by the principles of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN).

### Our Commitments
-   **Non-partisanship**: We strive to verify claims objectively, regardless of their origin or political leaning.
-   **Transparency**: Our process is designed to be understandable, with results clearly showing the AI probability, supporting evidence, and verdict reasoning.
-   **Accuracy**: While we leverage AI and automated systems, we acknowledge the need for human judgment and clearly state our limitations.
-   **Continuous Improvement**: As AI technology evolves, so do our methods. We are committed to updating our tools and processes.

### How the Tool Works

Our system employs a hybrid approach, combining automated analysis with real-time web searches to assess claims. Here's a breakdown:

| Stage                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Technologies/Logic Used                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Content Fetching** | Retrieves the text content from a provided URL, stripping out irrelevant HTML tags and focusing on the main article body. This step includes robust error handling and retry mechanisms to manage network instability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | `requests` with `HTTPAdapter` and `urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing.                                                         |
| **2. AI Detection**    | Analyzes chunks of the fetched text using a pre-trained AI model to calculate the probability that the text was generated by AI. This is performed via the Hugging Face Inference API to avoid large model downloads on free-tier servers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Hugging Face Inference API (`openai-community/roberta-base-openai-detector`), chunking text (`ai_chunk_size`) to manage memory.                        |
| **3. Claim Extraction**  | Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify and extract individual factual claims or statements from the article text. Claims are filtered based on length and content relevance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Regular Expressions (`re`) for sentence splitting and keyword identification.                                                                            |
| **4. Live Cross-Referencing** | For each extracted claim, the system performs real-time searches using DuckDuckGo. It looks for both supporting evidence (confirmations, true, evidence) and challenging evidence (false, hoax, debunked) from various online sources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `duckduckgo_search` API for real-time search queries.                                                                                                    |
| **5. Verdict Generation**| Combines the AI generation probability score with the findings from the cross-referencing stage. The "Overall Verdict" is a weighted assessment, considering whether the claim is likely true, false, misleading, or if there's insufficient evidence. This logic is inspired by IFCN rating guidelines. | Weighted logic combining AI probability (`ai_score`) and claim verification results (`support_count`, `challenge_count`).                             |

### AI-Specific Focus & Technical Transparency

Our system is specifically tuned to identify and analyze AI-generated content and misinformation.

*   **Textual Analysis**: We employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) to effectively extract factual claims from long-form articles, focusing on the core statements made.
*   **Confidence Scoring**: Unlike simple binary classifications, our AI detection provides a percentage-based confidence score, reflecting the mathematical probability of AI generation. This offers a more nuanced view than a "Yes/No" label.
*   **IFCN-Aligned Logic**: The "Overall Verdict" provided is a carefully considered combination. It weighs the AI probability score against the evidence (or lack thereof) found during our live cross-referencing. This approach mirrors the rigorous standards of fact-checking organizations.

### Limitations

As a prototype operating on a free-tier server, RealAI Check has certain limitations that are important for users to understand:

*   **Cold Starts**: Due to the use of serverless functions and the need to load AI models on demand, the initial analysis of a URL (a "cold start") may take between 30–60 seconds. Subsequent analyses within a short timeframe might be faster.
*   **Human Review is Essential**: While our AI detection aims for high accuracy (estimated 80-90% for AI generation probability), it is a tool to *assist* human judgment, not replace it. Complex nuances, satire, or evolving narratives may require human interpretation.
*   **Scraping Blocks**: Some websites employ measures to block automated scraping. This can result in "Fetch Errors" (like 403 Forbidden or 401 Unauthorized responses), preventing the analysis of content from those specific sites. We recommend trying alternative URLs or the manual text submission feature if available.
*   **Search Engine Limitations**: The accuracy of our cross-referencing depends on the information available via the search engine (DuckDuckGo) and the quality of the indexed content.

We are committed to improving these aspects as the project develops. Thank you for trusting RealAI Check.
