# Our Methodology

RealAI Check follows international standards (inspired by IFCN principles):

- **Non-partisanship**: We check claims from all sides equally.
- **Transparency**: Every verdict cites primary sources with links.
- **Verification process**:
  1. Detect viral claims via social media monitoring.
  2. Research using reliable tools (reverse image search, metadata analysis, official statements).
  3. Rate: True / Mostly True / Misleading / False / Unverifiable.
  4. Publish with full explanation and evidence.
- **Corrections**: Errors? We update promptly with notes.
- **AI focus**: Special tools for detecting deepfakes/synthetics (e.g., frame analysis, watermark checks).
